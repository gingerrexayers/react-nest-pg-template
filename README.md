## 📂 Project Structure

This project is a monorepo managed with `pnpm` workspaces.

│   ├── client/       # React (Vite) Frontend
│   └── server/       # NestJS Backend

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the application running locally for development.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: `v22.x` or later
- **pnpm**: `v10.x` or later
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is recommended.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd react-nest-pg-template
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies from the root directory:**
    This command will install dependencies for all workspaces (`client` and `server`).

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development environment:**
    This script will start the server, client, and database containers using `docker-compose`. The client and server will be running in development mode with hot-reloading enabled.

    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

    - **Backend API** will be available at `http://localhost:3001`
    - **Frontend App** will be available at `http://localhost:3005`
    - **PostgreSQL Database** will be available on port `5432`

4.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Once the containers are running, open a new terminal window and run the database migrations. This command executes the TypeORM CLI inside the running `server` container to set up the database schema.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec server pnpm --filter server run migration:run
    ```

You should now be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3005`, register a new user, and start using the app!

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project includes unit tests for the server and end-to-end (E2E) tests for the client application.

### Server Unit Tests

Unit tests for the NestJS server are located in the `packages/server` directory and use Jest.

To run the server tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter server run test
```

### Client End-to-End Tests

The client application uses Cypress for end-to-end testing to simulate real user scenarios.

**To run the E2E tests, you must have the development environment running in a separate terminal:**

```bash
# In terminal 1: Start the application
./start.sh
```

**Then, in a second terminal, you can run Cypress:**

- **Interactive Mode (Recommended for development):**
  Opens the Cypress Test Runner UI where you can watch tests run in real-time.
  ```bash
  # From the project root
  pnpm --filter client run cy:open
  ```
- **Headless Mode (For CI/automation):**
  Runs all tests in the terminal without launching a browser UI.
  ```bash
  # From the project root
  pnpm --filter client run cy:run
  ```

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `pnpm serve:client`: Serves the built client application for preview.

### Server Workspace (`packages/server`)

To run these scripts, you can either `cd packages/server` or use the `pnpm --filter` command from the root (e.g., `pnpm --filter server run lint`).

- `pnpm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript source to JavaScript.
- `pnpm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

### Client Workspace (`packages/client`)

- `pnpm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `pnpm run build`: Builds the client application for production.
- `pnpm run lint`: Lints the codebase.
- `pnpm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

## 📦 Production

To build and run the application in a production-like environment, use the main `docker-compose.yaml` file.

1.  **Build the production Docker images:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build
    ```

2.  **Run the production containers:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3005`.

## 📖 API Endpoints

The backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints. Protected routes require a valid JWT `Bearer` token.

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                                     |
| ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/health`        | Health check for the service and DB connection. |
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | Register a new canvasser account.               |
| `POST` | `/auth/login`    | Log in and receive a JWT token.                 |
